# 🧠 Cybersecurity Journey

This repository documents my hands-on work in cybersecurity, with a focus on system analysis, network defense, and offensive security testing.

Each project represents a practical experiment, tool, or prototype built to solve a real problem, automate a task, or explore a security concept in depth.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- `projects/` — applied cybersecurity projects, tools, and system-level experiments.

Each project includes its own `README.md` describing:
- the objective or threat model
- implementation details
- usage instructions
- results, findings, or limitations

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is **not coursework** and not a collection of theoretical notes.

It is a practical, reproducible record of my learning process and hands-on experience in cybersecurity, systems, and networking.  
Everything here can be reviewed, tested, modified, and improved.

---

## 🧩 Learning Process

I am actively learning, experimenting, and refining my skills.  
Some projects may be incomplete, imperfect, or exploratory by design.

My primary learning sources include:
- **YouTube** — for walkthroughs, tool demonstrations, and real-world attack simulations
- **ChatGPT** — for breaking down complex concepts, debugging code, and understanding system behavior

This repository is about **progress, consistency, and applied learning**, not perfection.
