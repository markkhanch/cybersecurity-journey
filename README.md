# 🧠 Cybersecurity Journey

This repository documents my practical work in cybersecurity — focused on systems analysis, network defense, and offensive security testing.  
Each project inside `projects/` is built to solve a real problem, automate a task, or demonstrate a concept I’ve studied.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- `projects/` — personal tools, experiments, and applied labs in cybersecurity.

Each project includes its own `README.md` explaining:
- objective or threat model  
- implementation details  
- usage instructions  
- test results or outcomes

## 📈 Purpose

This repository is not coursework — it’s practical documentation.  
The goal is to create a clear, verifiable record of hands-on experience in network and system security, as well as other personal projects.  
Everything here can be reproduced, tested, and improved.

## 🧩 Learning Process

I’m still learning. Many of these projects are experiments, and some may contain mistakes or incomplete ideas.  
My main learning sources are **YouTube** (for visual walkthroughs, tool demos, and real attack simulations) and **ChatGPT**, which I use to break down concepts, debug code, and understand systems at a deeper level.  

This repo is not about perfection — it’s about progress and persistence.
