# Mini Hacker Pi 🧠💻

**Mini Hacker Pi** is a personal open-source project that transforms a small computing board into a portable hacker’s Swiss knife — a compact device packed with small, modular tools for network exploration, automation, and experimentation.

This project is still evolving, and most of it is being built collaboratively with the help of **ChatGPT**, so not everything here is perfect, fully optimized, or even finished — but that’s the fun part.  
The goal is to learn, document, and iterate.

## 🚀 Overview
The idea behind **Mini Hacker Pi** is to create a lightweight, self-contained multi-tool platform — something that can run scripts, network utilities, and local dashboards, while staying portable and minimal.

The project is meant to serve as both:
- A **learning environment** for cybersecurity and embedded Linux experiments.
- A **foundation** for adding new tools and documenting them cleanly through GitHub.

---

## 🧩 Project Goals
- **Modularity** — each function or tool is stored in its own folder under `tools/` with its own documentation.  
- **Self-containment** — minimal dependencies, easy setup, no need for external servers.  
- **Transparency** — all code, tests, and configurations are open for review and contribution.  
- **Documentation-first approach** — everything that can be explained, *will* be explained.

## ⚙️ Current State
This repository is **WIP (Work in Progress)**.  
Currently, it focuses on:
- Building a solid structure and naming convention.  
- Documenting the process of developing each tool.  
- Setting up CI/CD for testing and linting (GitHub Actions).  
- Ensuring new tools can be added quickly with a minimal template.

## 💡 How to Use
Each utility or sub-project lives inside `tools/<tool_name>`.
